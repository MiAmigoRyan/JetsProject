# JetsProject
This program needs to be compiled
and run through an IDE that supports Java 8.
# Overview
The program Jets Project reads from a .txt file (jets.txt)
and organizes the elements of that .txt file in a way that
provides examples of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.
These are foundational concepts in Object Oriented Programming.

# Lessons Learned

I learned the process by which inheritance and polymorphism are
applied.
Specifically in using an Application (JetApplication class) to call
two different classes (AirField.java and Jet.java) one of which called a number of subclasses.
Additionally I learned how to apply an Interface to a number of classes.
While I found this project complex  in organization. The logic of all the methods used felt fairly simple. I am beginning to see how the tools and skills I am learning build upon each other. As I look forward I am eager to continue to increase my knowledge and application of OOP
